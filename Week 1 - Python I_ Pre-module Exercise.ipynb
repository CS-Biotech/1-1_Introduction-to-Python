    "# Week 1: Introduction to Python programming for biology students 🧪\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome! This is the first of many modules in this course designed to help you learn various programming tools for biologists. Over the course of this semester, you will learn the following:\n",
    "1. Python programming\n",
    "2. Data science with Pandas\n",
    "3. Machine Learning fundamentals\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of learning programming as a biologist is not to become an expert software developer (although you certainly can!), but to *understand how to use programming as a tool* to:\n",
    "1. automate and accelerate computation\n",
    "2. organize and visualize data\n",
    "3. employ statistical/machine learning models to reach conclusions about datasets\n",
    "\n",
    "...all within a scientific context. Whether you will work in a research lab or a corporate setting, these skills will complement your biology background. We hope you find these modules helpful as you continue your undergraduate studies.\n",

    "1. Jupyter Notebooks\n",
    "2. Variables and datatypes in Python\n",

We highly encourage you to look up the documentation for certain functions or do quick Google searches for additional help as we go along. The goal here is not to know every feature and function of Python by heart, but to be able to find useful information and apply it to the problem you are trying to solve."

    "Variables persist throughout the notebook. Recall that in an earlier example, we added variables x and y together and assigned the result to z. Even though x, y, and z were assigned in a previous cell, we can access and reassign (overwrite) them in subsequent cells. Then, the effect of that action will be reflected when you run/re-run a cell with that variable anywhere in the notebook. You can see the execution order by referencing the number in square brackets to the left of each cell (if there is no number, that cell hasn't been executed yet). Typically notebooks are intended to be executed top to bottom.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, run CELL 1 below to see what the value of z is currently. Then, if you reassign variable z in CELL 2 and re-run CELL 1 above it, you will see that z is now the new reassigned value."

If you ran this twice, you would actually be adding 2). You can go to Cell > Run All to run all cells in the notebook from top to bottom."
