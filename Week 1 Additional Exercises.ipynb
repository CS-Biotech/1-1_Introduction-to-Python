    "# Week 1: Introduction to Python programming for biology students ðŸ§ª\n",
    "# Additional Exercises\n",
    "This week introduced you to Python programming and basic operations; you have successfully modified and added a record for Ahmed, a patient in the study! \n",
    "\n",
    "As you progress in these modules, the concepts presented may get increasingly complex. We will step you through each new concept slowly, but it is likely that you will find yourself stuck on an exercise at some point- even people who have been programming for decades will often encounter something they do not know! Thus, it is important to learn how to fill knowledge gaps efficiently while developing code. \n",

    "We would like to introduce two resources that every data scientist and developer should be familiar with:\n",
    "1. Documentation\n",
    "2. Stack Overflow\n",
    "\n",
    "## Documentation\n",
    "Have you ever been stuck in the middle of your sentence because you can't think of the right word? You know what you're trying to say in your head, but you're not quite sure how to say it. Or, perhaps you're having a conversation with someone and some of the words they used were completely new to you. In these cases, you would try searching for the word in a dictionary, which tells you the word, its spelling and meaning, what part of speech it belongs to, and examples of how it can be used in context.\n",
    "\n",
    "Like dictionaries help us speak a language the way it was intended, documentation helps programmers use programming languages, libraries, and software the way it was intended to be used. Documentation of entire languages and libraries like Python tend to be vast; they serve as references rather than manuals (you wouldn't sit down and read a dictionary page by page either!). When learning how to use a new language or technology, referencing the documentation as you develop your code is common practice. \n",
    "\n",
    "Recall that in this week's tutorial, we learned about if statements with a condition. We showed an example of how we can filter for patients between the ages 40 and 95, like below:"

Programmers usually follow one of two popular variable naming conventions, **snake case** and **camel case**. This is because the way we name variables have an impact on the readability of our code, which in turn impacts productivity and understanding; these two naming conventions have been widely adopted for their ease of use and readability. They look like this:\n",
